    "description": "The image showcases a modern Indian kitchen design characterized by clean lines, minimalistic contemporary elements, and the integration of traditional Indian aesthetics. The use of marble countertops and wooden cupboards reflects a blend of modern functionality and traditional Indian materials. The compact layout and modular design optimize space, making it suitable for smaller Indian homes. The lighting setup, with under-cabinet lights and natural daylight, enhances the brightness and spacious feel of the room. The color scheme of white, beige, and brown is popular in Indian interiors, providing a calm and inviting atmosphere.",
