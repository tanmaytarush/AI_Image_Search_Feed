The design incorporates elements that could be interpreted as modern adaptations of traditional Indian craftsmanship, such as the wainscoting pattern, though the overall aesthetic is distinctly modern. The metallic strips add a touch of sophistication, and the sliding doors maximize the use of space efficiently.",
