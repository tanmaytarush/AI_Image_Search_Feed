The sliding closet doors feature a sleek design with glass panels and metal frames, incorporating bright yellow accents that add a pop of color. The dark gray wall panels provide a modern, spacious look without overwhelming the space. The use of glass and metal materials reflects modern Indian design trends, combining functionality with style. The compact design of the sliding doors optimizes space within the bedroom, essential for smaller Indian homes. The smooth surfaces and minimalist approach highlight contemporary Indian design preferences, which often emphasize clean lines and a blend of traditional and modern elements.",
