The furniture, with its tufted seating and sleek metal legs, is modern yet pays homage to the use of metal in Indian furniture, such as brass and copper. The marble top adds a touch of natural elegance, reflecting Indian craftsmanship in stone work. The space is well-organized, maximizing the dining area within a compact space, and the overall design is a blend of modern aesthetics and traditional Indian influences.",
