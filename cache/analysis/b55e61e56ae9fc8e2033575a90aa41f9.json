    "description": "The image showcases a contemporary lounge with a touch of Indian design elements. The L-shaped sofa with white upholstery and wooden base is a modern interpretation of traditional seating. The marble flooring and wood shelving unit add a refined feel, while the geometric artwork on the wall brings in a more modern aesthetic. The use of natural materials like wood and marble, along with the clean lines and minimalist design, align with contemporary interpretations of traditional Indian design, such as the incorporation of natural motifs and the use of wood and stone in various forms.",
