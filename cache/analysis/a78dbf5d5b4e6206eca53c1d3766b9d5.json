The space features a U-shaped sectional sofa with white fabric and dark wood legs, a round wooden coffee table, and a marble flooring. The wall-mounted shelves with a geometric design and modern pendant lights add to the contemporary feel. Traditional elements are subtly integrated, such as the carved metal frames and geometric patterns, which are modern interpretations of classic Indian design. The overall space is open and spacious, with a clear division of areas, reflecting a balance between modern aesthetics and traditional Indian influences.",
