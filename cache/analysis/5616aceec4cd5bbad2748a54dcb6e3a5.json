      "description": "The image depicts a contemporary Indian bedroom with built-in wardrobes featuring sliding doors. The wardrobes are painted with a floral pattern in shades of brown, white, and gold, typical of Indian design. The sliding doors add a modern touch to the traditional floral motif. The space is well-lit with natural light coming from a window on the right, and the wood used for the wardrobes suggests a focus on natural materials, a common element in Indian interior design. The wardrobe design maximizes storage space, a practical adaptation in Indian homes.",
