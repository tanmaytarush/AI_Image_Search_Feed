The wardrobe features sliding doors, multiple compartments, and drawers, primarily constructed with wood and melamine. The color palette consists of white, gray, and brown, creating a modern and minimalist look. The smooth, glossy finish of the materials adds a touch of elegance to the space. The contemporary design subtly incorporates Indian influences, such as the choice of wood and the overall functionality, which is a common practice in modern Indian interior design.",
