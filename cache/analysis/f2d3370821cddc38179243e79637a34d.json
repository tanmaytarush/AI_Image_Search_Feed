    "description": "This image showcases a modern minimalist kitchen design with a compact dining area integrated into the cabinetry. The space features a sleek, metallic fridge that blends seamlessly into the cabinetry, with glass-paneled doors adding a touch of traditional elegance. The dining table and chairs have a contemporary design with metallic legs, and the kitchen is well-lit with under-cabinet lighting and pendant lights. The use of white, wood, and black creates a clean, sophisticated look, while the glass panels on the cabinet doors add a subtle Indian touch. The space is designed for efficient use of vertical space, making it ideal for a modern home.",
