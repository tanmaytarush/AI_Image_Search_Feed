The space features a polka dot wallpaper with a mix of green and beige dots, a sliding door with frosted glass panels and a black frame, and marble flooring. The door design, with its modern frosted glass panels, reflects a blend of traditional and modern Indian interior design principles. The wallpaper pattern subtly echoes traditional Indian textiles, adding a cultural touch to the otherwise modern space.",
