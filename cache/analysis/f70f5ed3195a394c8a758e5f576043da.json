      "description": "The image depicts a modern bedroom with a blend of traditional and contemporary design elements. The focal point is a multi-door wardrobe with a white and orange color scheme, featuring horizontal stripes and metal hardware, reflecting a modern aesthetic. Adjacent to the wardrobe is an open shelving unit with an integral design, painted in orange, which complements the overall color scheme. The room is illuminated by natural light from a window, and the floor is covered with a light gray material. The design does not exhibit any overt Indian regional influences or traditional furniture styles, focusing instead on a minimalist and functional approach.",
